# Markdown-HTML Converter Application

The __Markdown-HTML Converter Application__ is a web application that allows users to convert markdown text to HTML and vice versa. The application uses the Flask framework for Python and the html2markdown package for the conversion.

## Usage

To use the application, navigate to the application's URL in your web browser. You will see a text area labeled "Markdown Input" and a "Convert" button. Enter your markdown text into the text area and click the "Convert" button to convert the markdown to HTML. The resulting HTML will appear in the text area labeled "HTML Output".

To convert HTML to markdown, simply copy and paste your HTML code into the "HTML Input" text area and click the "Convert" button. The resulting markdown will appear in the text area labeled "Markdown Output".

## Implementation Details

The application is built using the Flask framework for Python. The front-end of the application is implemented using HTML and JavaScript, and the back-end is implemented using Python.

The conversion from markdown to HTML is handled by the html2markdown package, which is a Python library that converts HTML to markdown and vice versa.

The conversion process is initiated by clicking the "Convert" button on the front-end of the application. The JavaScript code in the front-end sends a request to the back-end of the application, passing the markdown or HTML text as a parameter. The back-end then uses the html2markdown package to convert the text and sends the converted text back to the front-end, where it is displayed in the appropriate text area.

## Future Work

In the future, we plan to add additional functionality to the application, such as the ability to save converted markdown or HTML files to disk, and the ability to upload markdown or HTML files for conversion. Additionally, we plan to improve the formatting and user interface of the application to make it more user-friendly and visually appealing.

    Input validation:
    
    
    
    *   Add validation to the input HTML to prevent malicious code injection or other security vulnerabilities.
    
    
    
3.   
    
    Preview feature:
    
    
    
    *   Add a preview feature that allows users to see a live preview of the converted Markdown as they type their HTML input.
    
    
    
4.   
    
    Save and load feature:
    
    
    
    *   Add a feature that allows users to save their converted Markdown or their HTML input to a file.

5.   
    
    Theme customization:
    
    
    
    *   Allow users to customize the theme and appearance of the application with options for different color schemes, font styles, and other visual elements.
    
    
    
6.   
    
    Advanced Markdown features:

    HTML and Markdown formatting options:
    
    
    
    *   Allow users to choose formatting options for the output Markdown such as line breaks, code block highlighting, and other features.
    
    
    
8.   
    
    Integration with other tools:
